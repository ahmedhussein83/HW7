        <p>Prison Break is an American television series that premiered on the Fox Network on August 29, 2005. 
        The story revolves around a man who was sentenced to death for a 
        crime he did not commit and his brother's elaborate plan to help him escape his death sentence.</p>
        <p>he origins of Prison Break began as a concept (a man deliberately getting himself sent to prison in order
        to help someone else escape) that was suggested to Paul Scheuring by producer Dawn Parouse, who had wanted to 
        produce an action oriented series. Although Scheuring thought it was a good idea, he was initially stumped as 
        to why someone would embark on such a mission or how he could develop it into a viable television show.</p>
        <p>He later came up with the story of the wrongfully accused brother and the conspiracy subplot. He then began 
        working on the plot outline and devising the characters. In 2003, he pitched the idea to the Fox Broadcasting 
        Company, but was turned down as Fox felt somewhat nervous about the long-term possibilities of such a series. 
        He subsequently showed the concept to other channels with no luck.In 2003, he pitched the idea to the Fox 
        Broadcasting Company, but was turned down as Fox felt somewhat nervous about the long-term possibilities of 
        such a series. He subsequently showed the concept to other channels with no luck. Scheuring and his fellow 
        producers later remarked that many had thought that the story would be more suited for a film project than a 
        television series. The show was later considered as a possible 14-part miniseries, which drew the interest of 
        Steven Spielberg before his departure due to his involvement with War of the Worlds. Thus, the miniseries never 
        materialized. Following the huge popularity of serialized prime time television series such as Lost and 24,
        the Fox Network had a change of heart and backed the production in 2004.On October 24, 2006, it was reported
        by the Associated Press that Donald and Robert Hughes filed a lawsuit against Fox Broadcasting Company and the 
        show's executive producer and creator, Paul Scheuring, for copyright infringement, seeking unspecified damages 
        and other costs. They claimed that in 2001, they had sent Fox their manuscript which was based on their own 
        experiences of a prison break at a juvenile facility. In the 1960s, Donald Hughes planned and successfully 
        executed a prison escape for his brother, Robert Hughes, who was wrongfully incarcerated. On March 27, 2007, 
        a third season was announced.</p>
